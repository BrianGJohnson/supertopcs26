## Algorithm Targets

These are the YouTube algorithm signals we want to tap. GPT picks 2-3 that apply to each phrase.

**The 14 Algorithm Targets:**

**Long-Term Views**
Timeless content that compounds views over months and years. Not dependent on trends or timing.
Example: "How to edit videos" — people search this every day.

**High Click Trigger**
Topic that naturally drives clicks. The phrase itself creates curiosity or urgency.
Example: "Why your videos aren't getting views" — you HAVE to click.

**View Multiplier**
Topic suited for a 3-5 video series. Viewers who find one video will watch the others.
Strategy: Publish multiple related videos to boost session time and channel authority.
Example: "YouTube Shorts" could become 5 videos covering different angles.

**High Intent**
Viewers are ready to take action, not just browse. Often correlates with long-term views.
Example: "Best camera for YouTube 2025" — they're ready to buy.

**Polarizing & Engaging**
Sparks discussion, debate, and comments. Viewers have opinions and will share them.
Example: "Why I stopped using [popular thing]" — people will argue.

**Return Viewer**
Brings viewers back to your channel. Great for series content and building audience habits.
Example: Weekly updates, ongoing series, "Part 2" content.

**Loyalty Builder**
Content that turns casual viewers into regulars. Creates connection and habit.
Viewers think: "I need to check back for more from this creator."
Example: Personality-driven content, consistent format viewers expect.

**Masterclass Method**
Exhaustive, definitive content. "The best guide on the internet" for this topic.
Long-form (30-60+ min), high watch time, establishes you as THE authority.
Example: "The Complete Guide to Vibe Coding" — one video, everything they need.

**Trust Builder**
Vulnerable, honest content. Admitting mistakes, sharing struggles, being real.
Creates deep connection. Viewers subscribe because they trust you.
Example: "I was wrong about..." or "What I learned from failing at..."

**Transformational View Boost**
Story-driven content with a journey: struggle → growth → result.
Keeps viewers watching to see the outcome. Boosts average view duration.
Example: "I tried X for 30 days" or "How I went from 0 to 100K subscribers."
Primary metric: Average View Duration

**Secret Strategy**
"What they don't tell you" / "Hidden secrets of" / "The truth about..."
A play on curiosity. Viewers MUST click to find out what's being hidden.
Works because curiosity is irresistible. Creates immediate interest.
Example: "What YouTube doesn't want you to know about the algorithm."
Primary metric: Click-Through Rate (CTR)

**Mistakes & Warnings**
"Don't do this" / "X mistakes killing your..." / "What I wish I knew before..."
Fear-driven content. No one wants to mess up or miss something important.
Works because fear of loss is stronger than desire for gain.
Example: "5 mistakes that will kill your YouTube channel."
Primary metric: CTR + Trust (subscribers)

**Comparison Trigger**
"X vs Y" / "Which is better?" / "I tested both so you don't have to"
Decision-making content. Viewers have a choice to make and need your verdict.
Works because viewers stay to see the conclusion. High intent = ready to act.
Example: "iPhone vs Android for video — which is actually better?"
Primary metric: Average View Duration + High Intent

**Story Hook**
Personal narratives, "The time I..." / "What happened when..." / Storytime
Stories hold attention like nothing else. Emotional connection builds loyalty.
Works because humans are wired for narrative. We need to see how it ends.
Example: "The worst client I ever had" or "How I almost quit YouTube."
Primary metric: Average View Duration + Loyalty
