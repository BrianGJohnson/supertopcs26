## What is a SuperTopic?

A **SuperTopic** is a video topic that represents an exceptional opportunity for a specific creator. It's not just a "good keyword" - it's a topic where multiple signals align to create outsized potential.

**The key insight:** A SuperTopic is personal. What's a SuperTopic for one creator may not be for another.

---

## The Philosophy

### SuperTopics Are Contextual

A topic becomes a SuperTopic based on:

1. **The Creator's Goals** - What are they trying to achieve?
2. **The Creator's Channel** - Does this fit their audience?
3. **The Market Reality** - Is there demand? Is there room to compete?
4. **The Timing** - Is this evergreen or trending?

### Not Just High Volume

Traditional SEO tools chase high-volume keywords. But high volume often means:
- High competition
- Established players
- Hard to break through

**SuperTopics finds the gaps** - topics with real demand but low competition.

### Not Just Low Competition

Low competition alone isn't enough. A phrase nobody searches for has "low competition" but zero opportunity.

**SuperTopics require demand** - real people searching, watching, subscribing.

---

## Ways a Topic Becomes a SuperTopic

### 1. The Sweet Spot Pattern 🎯

**Low exact match + High topic match + High suggestions**

This means:
- People ARE searching for this topic (demand exists)
- But NOT with these exact words (low competition)
- And the topic is unified (semantic coherence)

**Example:** "How to introduce yourself on YouTube"
- 14 suggestions (maximum demand)
- 7% exact match (almost no competition)
- 100% topic match (everyone wants the same thing)
- **Result:** #1 ranking, 30K views, major subscriber growth

This is a **SuperTopic** because the algorithm detected something rare: maximum demand with minimal competition.

### 2. The Buying Intent Pattern 💰

**Low demand + High buying intent + Low competition**

For creators selling products/services, a phrase with:
- Lower search volume
- But clear purchase intent
- And few competitors

...is more valuable than a high-volume phrase with no intent.

**Example:** "best CRM for YouTube creators"
- Maybe only 50 searches/month
- But those 50 people are READY TO BUY
- Few videos target this specifically
- **SuperTopic for someone selling to creators**

### 3. The Long-Term Views Pattern 📈

**Evergreen topic + Room to rank + Compounds over time**

Some topics aren't trending - they're permanent. People will search for them forever:
- "How to..." tutorials
- Beginner guides
- Foundational concepts

A phrase that:
- Has consistent (not spiking) demand
- You can rank for
- Will bring views for years

...is a SuperTopic because it compounds.

**Example:** "How to introduce yourself on YouTube"
- Not a trend - people ALWAYS start YouTube channels
- Ranked #1 within days
- Still getting views 10 months later
- **SuperTopic because it compounds**

### 4. The Audience Builder Pattern 👥

**High audience fit + Subscriber conversion potential**

Some topics attract viewers. Some topics attract **subscribers**.

A phrase where:
- The searcher matches your target audience exactly
- Watching this video leads to "I need more from this channel"
- High subscribe-after-watch rate

...is a SuperTopic even if volume is moderate.

**Example:** A channel about "starting a YouTube channel" publishing "how to introduce yourself on YouTube"
- Perfect audience match (new creators)
- Viewer thinks "this channel has what I need"
- Subscribes for the journey
- **SuperTopic because it builds the audience**

### 5. The Niche Domination Pattern 🏆

**Tight niche + 100% topic relevance + Ownable**

Sometimes a phrase is so specific that:
- ALL suggestions are about the same thing
- You can become THE authority
- Once you rank, you own it

**Example:** "AI Thumbnail Roblox"
- Only 5 suggestions (niche)
- But 100% topic match (all about Roblox thumbnails)
- Tight, ownable niche
- **SuperTopic for the right creator**

---

## The SuperTopic Score

When our algorithm calculates a phrase's potential, it produces a raw score:

| Raw Score | Designation | Meaning |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| **100+** | 🌟 **SuperTopic** | Exceptional - all signals align |
| 70-99 | 🟢 Go | Strong opportunity |
| 50-69 | 🟢 Go | Good opportunity |
| 35-49 | 🟡 Caution | Check manually |
| 20-34 | 🟡 Caution | Limited signals |
| <20 | 🔴 Stop | Low potential |

### How the Score is Calculated

```
Demand Score (0-40)
  + Topic Relevance Bonus (0-30)
  + Competition Score (-10 to +30)
  + Sweet Spot Bonus (0-15)
  = Raw Score
```

When raw score exceeds 100, the phrase has **exceeded expectations** across multiple dimensions. This earns the **SuperTopic** designation.

---

## SuperTopic Designation in the App

When a topic is identified as a SuperTopic:

- **Opportunity Modal:** Shows 🌟 SuperTopic badge with logo
- **Refine Table:** Highlighted row with star indicator
- **Signal:** Goes beyond "Go" to "SuperTopic"

This helps creators immediately identify their highest-potential opportunities.

---

## The Opportunity Modal: Adaptive Display

The modal adapts its display based on **phrase length** because short and long phrases require different analysis approaches.

### Why Word Count Matters

| Words | What We're Measuring | Competition Assessment |
|-------|---------------------|----------------------|
| 2-3 | "Is this topic worth exploring?" | Not yet meaningful |
| 4+ | "Is this THE phrase to target?" | Fully meaningful |

### Short Phrases (2-3 words)

When a user enters a seed like **"AI Thumbnail"**:

- We're at the **START** of the discovery process
- High exact match is **expected and normal** (everyone uses these words)
- We can't fully assess competition yet
- **Display:** Simple Go/Caution/Stop signal
- **Question answered:** "Should we expand this topic?"

### Long Phrases (4+ words)

When evaluating a phrase like **"How to introduce yourself on YouTube"**:

- We're **DEEPER** in the discovery process
- Low exact match is **meaningful** (real competitive advantage)
- We can calculate a true opportunity score
- **Display:** Full Opportunity Score with Demand/Competition breakdown
- **Question answered:** "How good is this specific phrase?"

### Modal Behavior

```
IF word_count <= 3:
  → Show: Go/Caution/Stop signal
  → Show: Basic demand indicators
  → Message: "Is this topic worth exploring?"

IF word_count >= 4:
  → Show: Opportunity Score (0-100 bar)
  → Show: Demand card + Competition card
  → Show: SuperTopic badge if score >= 85
  → Message: "How strong is this opportunity?"
```

### The Reasoning

**2-word phrase: "AI Thumbnail"**
- Exact match will be ~100% (normal for short phrases)
- This doesn't mean high competition - it means we need more data
- The full expansion will reveal the real opportunities

**6-word phrase: "How to introduce yourself on YouTube"**
- Exact match at 7% is genuinely LOW competition
- This IS the signal we're looking for
- We can score and potentially designate as SuperTopic

---

## The First Documented SuperTopic

### "How to introduce yourself on YouTube"

**The Data:**
| Signal | Value | Interpretation |
|--------|-------|----------------|
| Suggestions | 14 | Maximum possible |
| Exact Match | 7% | Almost no competition |
| Topic Match | 100% | Perfect coherence |
| Raw Score | 115 | Exceeds SuperTopic threshold |

**The Results:**
| Metric | Outcome |
|--------|---------|
| Search Ranking | #1 within days |
| First Month | 8,000-10,000 views |
| 10 Months | 30,000+ views (still growing) |
| Subscribers | Significant channel growth |
| Lifespan | Evergreen - compounding |

**Why It's a SuperTopic:**
- ✅ Sweet Spot Pattern (low exact + high topic)
- ✅ Long-Term Views Pattern (evergreen, compounds)
- ✅ Audience Builder Pattern (perfect fit, converts to subscribers)

This phrase hit **three SuperTopic patterns simultaneously**. That's rare. That's why it performed so exceptionally.

---

## What SuperTopics Is NOT

### Not an SEO Tool
We're not optimizing for search rankings. We're finding topics that **connect with humans**.

### Not a Keyword Planner
We don't show search volume numbers. We show **opportunity signals**.

### Not One-Size-Fits-All
A SuperTopic is personal. The same phrase can be a SuperTopic for one creator and irrelevant for another.

### Not About Gaming the Algorithm
YouTube's algorithm rewards content that satisfies viewers. We find topics where you can satisfy viewers AND get discovered.

---

## The Vision

SuperTopics helps YouTube creators find the topics that will:

1. **Get discovered** - Rank in search, appear in suggested
2. **Connect with viewers** - Match what people actually want
3. **Build audiences** - Attract subscribers, not just views
4. **Compound over time** - Evergreen performance

A SuperTopic is where all of these align.

---

## The Demand Score Algorithm (0-100)

The Demand Score measures **how much people want this topic**. It's calculated using a Parent + Child formula.

### The Formula

```
Demand Score = Parent Points + Child Points
```

- **Parent Points:** How many suggestions did the parent phrase have? (0-50)
- **Child Points:** How many suggestions does this phrase have? (0-50)

For Level 1 (seed phrases with no parent): `Demand = Child Points × 2`

### Suggestion Count → Points Mapping

Each suggestion count maps to points on a curve:

| Suggestions | Points | Notes |
|-------------|--------|-------|
| 14 | 50 | Maximum (YouTube shows max 14) |
| 13 | 47 | Near maximum |
| 12 | 44 | Very high |
| 11 | 40 | High |
| 10 | 36 | Strong |
| 9 | 32 | Good |
| 8 | 28 | Above average |
| 7 | 24 | Average |
| 6 | 20 | Below average |
| 5 | 16 | Low |
| 4 | 12 | Very low |
| 3 | 8 | Minimal |
| 2 | 4 | Almost none |
| 1 | 2 | Barely any |
| 0 | 0 | No suggestions |

### Demand Score Examples

**Example 1: Strong demand**
- Parent "YouTube video editing" had 14 suggestions = 50 points
- Current phrase has 9 suggestions = 32 points
- **Demand Score = 82** (High Demand ⚡)

**Example 2: Maximum demand**
- Parent had 14 suggestions = 50 points
- Current phrase has 14 suggestions = 50 points
- **Demand Score = 100** (Extreme Demand 🔥)

**Example 3: Level 1 seed phrase**
- No parent (this is the seed)
- Current phrase has 14 suggestions = 50 × 2 = 100
- **Demand Score = 100** (Extreme Demand 🔥)

**Example 4: Sparse data**
- Parent had 6 suggestions = 20 points
- Current phrase has 4 suggestions = 12 points
- **Demand Score = 32** (Low Demand ❄️)

### Demand Designations

| Score | Designation | Icon | Meaning |
|-------|-------------|------|---------|
| 85+ | Extreme Demand | 🔥 | Exceptional - top tier |
| 65-84 | High Demand | ⚡ | Strong - worth pursuing |
| 40-64 | Moderate Demand | 💡 | Decent - evaluate carefully |
| 0-39 | Low Demand | ❄️ | Sparse - may lack audience |

### SuperTopic Threshold

A phrase earns the **🏆 SuperTopic** designation when:
1. Demand Score ≥ 92
2. AND has 10+ suggestions
3. AND is NOT parent-informed (has its own data)

---

## The Opportunity Score Algorithm (0-100)

The Opportunity Score is a multi-signal algorithm that evaluates a phrase's **ranking potential** - how likely you are to get views from this phrase. It combines six key factors:

### 0. Demand Base (0-30 points)

**Even Level 1 phrases deserve credit for high demand**

Every phrase starts with a baseline opportunity score based on its suggestion count. This ensures that even seed phrases (Level 1) show reasonable opportunity when demand is high.

| Suggestions | Points | Meaning |
|-------------|--------|---------|
| 12+ | 30 | Maximum demand |
| 10-11 | 25 | Very high demand |
| 7-9 | 18 | Good demand |
| 5-6 | 12 | Moderate demand |
| 3-4 | 5 | Low demand |
| 0-2 | 0 | Minimal demand |

**Why this matters:** A phrase like "YouTube video editing" with 14 suggestions should show opportunity ~30-40 even at Level 1, not 0.

### 1. Depth Boost (0-40 points)

**DEEPER = EASIER TO RANK = HIGHER OPPORTUNITY**

The deeper you can drill while maintaining suggestions, the easier the phrase is to rank for. Long-tail phrases are less competitive.

| Level | Points | Meaning |
|-------|--------|---------|
| Level 1 (first drill) | 8 | Starting to drill |
| Level 2 | 18 | Good depth |
| Level 3 | 28 | Great depth - easier to rank |
| Level 4+ | 35 | Maximum depth - very easy to rank |

**Bonus:** +5 if parent had 10+ suggestions (sustained demand)

**Example:** "YouTube video editing" → "...tips" → "...tips and tricks"
- Level 3 = +28 points + sustained demand bonus
- Easier to rank = higher opportunity

### 2. Sweet Spot Boost (0-25 points)

**Low exact match + High topic match = Hidden Opportunity**

This pattern means:
- People ARE searching for this topic (high topic match)
- But NOT using these exact words (low exact match)
- **Translation:** Demand exists, but few videos target this specific phrase

| Exact Match | Topic Match | Points | Meaning |
|-------------|-------------|--------|---------|
| ≤20% | ≥80% | 25 | Perfect Sweet Spot |
| ≤30% | ≥60% | 20 | Great Sweet Spot |
| ≤40% | ≥50% | 12 | Good pattern |
| ≤50% | ≥40% | 5 | Slight pattern |

**Example:** "How to introduce yourself on YouTube"
- 7% exact match = almost nobody using these words
- 100% topic match = everyone wants the same thing
- = 25 point Sweet Spot boost

### 3. Position Power (0-18 points)

**What is "Position"?**

When you drill down into a phrase, you click on one of the suggestions. That suggestion appeared at a specific position in the list (1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc.).

**Position 1 = YouTube's algorithm thinks this is THE most relevant expansion of that phrase.**

This is a strong signal because YouTube's autocomplete is powered by:
- What people actually search for
- What gets clicks
- What leads to satisfying results

**How Position Power Works:**

| Position in Parent's Suggestion List | Base Points | With 10+ Siblings |
|--------------------------------------|-------------|-------------------|
| #1 (top of list) | 15 | +3 bonus |
| #2 | 12 | +3 bonus |
| #3-4 | 8 | - |
| #5-7 | 4 | - |
| #8+ | 0 | - |

**The "10+ Siblings" Bonus:**
If the parent phrase had 10+ suggestions, being in the top 2 positions is extra meaningful - you beat out many competitors for that spot. +3 bonus.

**Example:**
You drilled into "YouTube video editing" and clicked "YouTube video editing course" which was listed **first** in the suggestions.
- Position = 1 → 15 points
- Parent had 14 suggestions (10+) → +3 bonus
- **Total Position Power = 18 points**

### 4. Relevancy Boost (0-20 points)

**The "Ranking Ladder" Concept**

When your child phrase **contains** the parent phrase, ranking for the specific child often helps you rank for the broader parent. This creates a ladder:

```
"YouTube video editing course free" (easiest to rank)
        ↓ helps you rank for
"YouTube video editing course" 
        ↓ helps you rank for
"YouTube video editing" (hardest to rank)
```

**How Relevancy Boost Works:**

| Relationship | Points |
|--------------|--------|
| Child starts with parent phrase exactly | 15 |
| Strong word overlap (but not exact start) | 10 |
| Also matches grandparent (full ladder) | +5 |

**Example:** 
- Grandparent: "YouTube video editing"
- Parent: "YouTube video editing course"
- Child: "YouTube video editing course free"

The child starts with the parent phrase exactly (+15) AND the full ladder goes back to grandparent (+5) = **20 points**

### 5. Long-Term Views Boost (0-26 points)

**Evergreen Topic Detection**

Some topics will drive views for years, not days. We detect these by looking for specific **evergreen keywords** that indicate educational, how-to, or foundational content.

**Evergreen Prefixes (start of phrase):**
```
how, how to, how do, how does, how can, how should
what, what is, what are, what does, what do, what should
why, why is, why are, why does, why do, why should
when, when to, when should, when do, when does
where, where to, where can, where do
which, which is, which are
who, who is, who are, who can
can you, can i, should i, should you
is it, are there, do i, do you
learn, learn to, learn how
guide to, guide for, introduction to
ways to, steps to, ideas for
best, best way, best ways, top
improve, fix, solve
```

**Evergreen Suffixes (anywhere in phrase):**
```
tutorial, tutorials, guide, guides, course, courses
class, classes, lesson, lessons, training
walkthrough, demonstration, demo
beginner, beginners, for beginners
basics, basic, fundamentals, essentials
advanced, intermediate, masterclass
tips, tricks, tips and tricks
hacks, secrets, techniques
strategies, tactics, methods
step by step, step-by-step, complete guide
full guide, ultimate guide, explained
introduction, intro, overview
review, reviews, comparison, vs
fixed, solved, solution, solutions
troubleshoot, troubleshooting
learn, learning, teach, teaching
practice, exercises, examples
```

**How Long-Term Views Boost Works:**

| Pattern | Points |
|---------|--------|
| Has evergreen prefix OR suffix | 12 |
| Above + has 10+ suggestions | 18 |
| "how to" prefix or "tutorial" (strongest signals) | +3 |
| Sustained demand from parent (70+ demand) | +5 |

**Maximum: 26 points** (18 + 3 + 5)

**Why This Matters:**

| Topic Type | Lifespan | Example |
|------------|----------|---------|
| Evergreen | Years | "How to edit YouTube videos for beginners" |
| News/Trending | Days/Weeks | "YouTube algorithm update December 2025" |

A video with evergreen keywords will get views as long as the topic exists. "How to introduce yourself on YouTube" will get views as long as people start YouTube channels. That's forever.

---

## Level 1 Specificity Boost

**Not all Level 1 phrases need drilling**

Some phrases arrive already specific and actionable. "How to introduce yourself on YouTube" is 6 words, starts with "how to", and has high demand. It doesn't NEED drilling - it IS the opportunity.

We detect these and give them a depth boost even at Level 1:

| Criteria | Points |
|----------|--------|
| 6+ words + strong evergreen + 10+ suggestions | 15 |
| 5+ words + strong evergreen + 8+ suggestions | 10 |

This ensures phrases like "How to introduce yourself on YouTube" score in the 80s, not 60s.

---

## Opportunity Score Examples

### Level 1 Seed: "YouTube video editing" (14 suggestions)
| Component | Points | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Demand base | 30 | 14 suggestions = max |
| Depth | 0 | Not drilled yet |
| Sweet Spot | 0 | 100% exact match (normal for seed) |
| Position | 0 | No parent |
| Relevancy | 0 | No parent |
| Long-term | 0 | No evergreen keywords |
| **Total** | **30** | Moderate - needs drilling |

### Level 2: "YouTube video editing tips" (9 suggestions, position #6)
| Component | Points | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Demand base | 18 | 9 suggestions |
| Depth | 18 | Level 2 |
| Sweet Spot | 5 | 44% exact, 100% topic |
| Position | 4 | Position #6 |
| Relevancy | 15 | Starts with parent |
| Long-term | 17 | Contains "tips" + sustained |
| **Total** | **77** | Strong opportunity! |

### Level 3: "YouTube video editing tips and tricks" (4 suggestions, position #2)
| Component | Points | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Demand base | 5 | 4 suggestions (sparse) |
| Depth | 28 | Level 3 - easier to rank |
| Sweet Spot | 0 | Sparse data |
| Position | 12 | Position #2 |
| Relevancy | 20 | Full ladder + grandparent |
| Long-term | 17 | Contains "tips" + sustained |
| **Total** | **82** | Excellent opportunity! |

**Key insight:** Level 3 has HIGHER opportunity than Level 2 despite fewer suggestions. Why? It's easier to rank for, has great position power, and full ranking ladder potential.

## Breadcrumb Path Tracking

The modal now tracks the **full drill-down path**:

```
Original Seed: "YouTube video editing"
      ↓
Level 1: "YouTube video editing course"
      ↓
Level 2: "YouTube video editing course free"
      ↓
Level 3: "Best free video editing course on YouTube"
```

This enables:
- **Depth scoring** - How many levels until autocomplete breaks?
- **Relevancy scoring** - Does each level build on the previous?
- **Sustained demand detection** - Is demand maintained across levels?
- **Ranking path visualization** - Clear ladder to climb

---

## Pattern Badges

When patterns are detected, they appear as badges in the Opportunity card:

| Badge | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| 🎯 **Sweet Spot** | Low exact + High topic match |
| 📈 **Long-Term** | Evergreen topic indicators |
| 🔍 **Deep Topic** | Level 3+ depth achieved |
| ⭐ **Top Position** | #1 or #2 in parent's suggestions |
