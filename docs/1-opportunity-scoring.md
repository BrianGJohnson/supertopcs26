# Opportunity Scoring

## Measuring Ranking Potential and Long-Term Views

**Version:** 1.0  
**Last Updated:** January 2025

---

## Overview

This document describes how SuperTopics scores **Opportunity** - the likelihood of ranking AND generating long-term views. Opportunity answers one question:

> **"If I make this video, will I rank and get views for years?"**

Unlike traditional "competition" metrics that just measure difficulty, Opportunity is a **positive score** - higher is better. It combines ranking potential with long-term views indicators.

---

## The Opportunity Philosophy

### Competition vs. Opportunity

**Traditional approach (Competition):**
> "How many videos exist for this keyword?" → Negative framing

**SuperTopics approach (Opportunity):**
> "What signals suggest I can rank AND sustain views?" → Positive framing

We don't just ask "is it hard?" - we ask "is this a *good* opportunity?"

---

## The Six Opportunity Components

```
Opportunity Score = Demand Base + Depth + Sweet Spot + Position + Relevancy + Long-Term
```

| Component | Max Points | What It Measures |
|-----------|------------|------------------|
| Demand Base | 30 | Baseline from viewer interest |
| Depth Boost | 38 | Long-tail = easier to rank |
| Sweet Spot | 25 | Untapped demand pattern |
| Position Power | 18 | YouTube's relevance signal |
| Relevancy Boost | 18 | Ranking ladder potential |
| Long-Term Views | 14 | Evergreen topic indicators |

**Maximum theoretical:** 143 points (capped at 100)

---

## Component 1: Demand Base (0-30 points)

**Purpose:** Establish baseline opportunity from demand.

Even without other signals, high demand indicates opportunity exists.

| Suggestions | Points |
|-------------|--------|
| 12+ | 30 |
| 10-11 | 25 |
| 7-9 | 18 |
| 5-6 | 12 |
| 3-4 | 5 |
| 0-2 | 0 |

---

## Component 2: Depth Boost (0-38 points)

**Purpose:** Reward long-tail phrases that are easier to rank for.

### The Depth Principle

Each level deeper = less competition = more opportunity:

```
Level 1: "YouTube video editing" (hardest)
Level 2: "YouTube video editing tips" (easier)
Level 3: "YouTube video editing tips and tricks" (even easier)
Level 4: "YouTube video editing tips and tricks for beginners" (easiest)
```

### Depth Scoring

| Level | Points | Meaning |
|-------|--------|---------|
| Level 1 | 0-10 | See Already-Specific below |
| Level 2 | 22 | Good depth |
| Level 3 | 30 | Great depth |
| Level 4+ | 35 | Maximum depth bonus |

**Parent Strength Bonus:** +3 if parent had 10+ suggestions (sustained demand)

### Already-Specific Phrases (Level 1 Exception)

Some phrases arrive already specific. They don't need drilling - they ARE the opportunity.

**The "How to Introduce Yourself" Pattern:**

```
"How to introduce yourself on YouTube"
- 6 words (already long-tail)
- Starts with "how to" (actionable intent)
- 14 suggestions (maximum demand)
```

This phrase doesn't need depth - it IS the specific, rankable phrase.

| Criteria | Points |
|----------|--------|
| 6+ words + evergreen pattern + 10+ suggestions | 10 |
| 5+ words + evergreen pattern + 8+ suggestions | 6 |

---

## Component 3: Sweet Spot Boost (0-25 points)

**Purpose:** Identify hidden opportunities competitors missed.

### The Sweet Spot Pattern

```
Low Exact Match + High Topic Match = Untapped Demand
```

- **Low Exact Match:** Few videos use these exact words
- **High Topic Match:** Everyone wants the same thing

**Translation:** Demand exists, but no one has claimed it.

### Sweet Spot Scoring

| Exact Match | Topic Match | Points |
|-------------|-------------|--------|
| ≤20% | ≥80% | 25 (Perfect) |
| ≤30% | ≥60% | 20 (Great) |
| ≤40% | ≥50% | 12 (Good) |
| ≤50% | ≥40% | 5 (Slight) |

### Real Example

**"How to introduce yourself on YouTube"**
- Exact Match: 7% (almost no one uses these words)
- Topic Match: 100% (all suggestions are about introductions)
- **Result:** 25 points (Perfect Sweet Spot 🎯)

---

## Component 4: Position Power (0-18 points)

**Purpose:** Reward YouTube's relevance endorsement.

When you drill into a phrase, the suggestion appeared at a position (1st, 2nd, etc.). Position #1 means YouTube thinks this is THE most relevant expansion.

### Position Scoring

| Position | Points |
|----------|--------|
| #1 | 15 |
| #2 | 12 |
| #3-4 | 8 |
| #5-7 | 4 |
| #8+ | 0 |

**High Competition Bonus:** +3 if parent had 10+ suggestions AND you're position #1-2. Being first among 14 options is meaningful.

---

## Component 5: Relevancy Boost (0-18 points)

**Purpose:** Identify ranking ladder potential.

### The Ranking Ladder

When your phrase contains the parent phrase, ranking for the child helps you rank for the parent:

```
"YouTube video editing course free" (rank here first)
        ↓ builds authority for
"YouTube video editing course"
        ↓ builds authority for
"YouTube video editing" (eventual goal)
```

### Relevancy Scoring

| Relationship | Points |
|--------------|--------|
| Child starts with parent exactly | 15 |
| Strong word overlap | 10 |
| Also matches grandparent | +3 |

**Maximum:** 18 points (15 + 3 grandparent bonus)

---

## Component 6: Long-Term Views (0-14 points)

**Purpose:** Identify evergreen topics that compound over time.

### The Long-Term Views Concept

Some videos get views for years. Others spike and die. We detect evergreen potential using pattern matching.

### Evergreen Indicators

**Question Prefixes** (indicate educational/how-to content):
```
how to, what is, why, when to, where to, which is
can you, should i, learn how, guide to, best way
```

**Topic Suffixes** (indicate lasting value):
```
tutorial, guide, course, beginner, basics, fundamentals
tips, tricks, step by step, explained, for beginners
```

### Long-Term Scoring (Word-Count Based)

| Word Count | Points |
|------------|--------|
| 6+ words | 14 |
| 5 words | 13 |
| 4 words | 12 |

**Why word-count based?** Longer phrases with evergreen patterns are more specific and have longer shelf life. Demand is already scored separately to avoid double-counting.

### The "How to Introduce Yourself" Effect

This video type:
- Gets searched forever (new YouTubers always exist)
- Compounds over time (SEO improves with watch time)
- Builds subscribers (attracts target audience)

**Result:** 30,000+ views over 10 months, still growing.

---

## Future Component: Emotional Context

*Planned for future implementation*

### The Concept

Phrases with emotional triggers have higher engagement:

- **Frustration:** "why won't my video upload"
- **Excitement:** "best camera for starting YouTube"
- **Urgency:** "how to fix copyright claim fast"
- **Aspiration:** "how to go viral on YouTube"

### Scoring Ideas

| Emotional Signal | Potential Points |
|------------------|------------------|
| Frustration keywords (fix, solve, help, stuck) | +5 |
| Excitement keywords (best, amazing, incredible) | +3 |
| Urgency keywords (fast, quick, now, urgent) | +4 |
| Aspiration keywords (viral, grow, success) | +3 |

*This will be implemented when we add GPT-based phrase analysis.*

## Opportunity Designations

| Score | Designation | Meaning |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| 85-100 | Excellent | Strong ranking potential - prioritize |
| 70-84 | Strong | Good opportunity - worth pursuing |
| 50-69 | Moderate | Evaluate carefully - may need more drilling |
| 30-49 | Limited | Challenging - consider alternatives |
| 0-29 | Minimal | Very difficult - avoid unless niche expert |

## Opportunity vs. Demand Matrix

| Demand | Opportunity | Recommendation |
|--------|-------------|----------------|
| High | High | 🟢 **Prioritize** - Best possible outcome |
| High | Low | 🟡 **Drill Deeper** - Find long-tail version |
| Low | High | 🟡 **Evaluate** - Easy to rank but small audience |
| Low | Low | 🔴 **Skip** - Neither demand nor opportunity |

---

## Implementation Reference

The Viewer Landscape Modal calculates opportunity using:

```typescript
function calculateOpportunityScore(
  phrase: string,
  suggestionCount: number,
  exactMatchPercent: number,
  topicMatchPercent: number,
  context: DrillDownContext | null
): { score: number; breakdown: OpportunityBreakdown }
```

Full implementation: `/src/components/ui/ViewerLandscapeModal.tsx`

## Key Takeaways

1. **Opportunity is positive** - We score what's good, not what's hard
2. **Six components** work together for complete picture
3. **Depth = Opportunity** - Long-tail phrases are easier to rank
4. **Sweet Spot = Gold** - Low exact + high topic = untapped demand
5. **Evergreen patterns** indicate long-term views potential
6. **Already-specific phrases** (like "how to introduce yourself") can be high opportunity at Level 1
7. **Emotional context** (future) will add engagement prediction
