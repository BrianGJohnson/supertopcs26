SUPER TOPICS — BRAND VOICE & TERMINOLOGY GUIDE v1.0
================================================================================

This document defines the language, tone, and philosophy for Super Topics.
All AI agents and contributors must follow these guidelines when writing
copy, UI text, descriptions, or any user-facing content.

================================================================================
SECTION 1: CORE PHILOSOPHY
================================================================================

THE HOOK:
We don't just find topics. We find SuperTopics.
That's the promise. That's what makes us different.

WHAT WE ARE:
Super Topics is a tool that helps YouTube creators discover topics their 
viewers actually want to watch. It's about understanding audience interest,
not gaming algorithms.

WHAT WE ARE NOT:
- An SEO tool
- A keyword research tool
- A search rankings optimizer
- A "hack the algorithm" service

THE MINDSET SHIFT:
Traditional tools focus on: "How do I rank higher in search?"
Super Topics focuses on: "What does my audience want to watch?"

CORE MODULE NAME:
The central methodology is called "Built for the Viewer" — every feature
should serve this philosophy.

KEY PHRASES TO USE:
- "Not just topics. SuperTopics."
- "Topics your audience is already watching"
- "What your viewers actually want"
- "Uncover the topics that connect"

================================================================================
SECTION 6: THE "WHY" — TALKING POINTS
================================================================================

When explaining Super Topics, emphasize:

1. THE SUPERTOPICS HOOK
   "We don't just find topics. We find SuperTopics — the ones your audience
   is already watching."

2. VIEWER-FIRST APPROACH
   "We help you find topics viewers are actively looking for — so you're
   creating content people actually want to watch."

3. BEYOND BASIC TOOLS
   "Most tools give you a list of keywords with numbers. We help you
   understand what your audience actually wants to see."

4. PERSONALIZED DISCOVERY
   "Your SuperTopics are unique to you — based on your niche, your
   exploration, and your creative direction."

5. NOT ABOUT GAMING THE SYSTEM
   "YouTube rewards videos that viewers love. We help you find those topics
   from the start, so the algorithm works WITH you, not against you."

LANGUAGE REMINDERS:
- Say "watching" not "searching for"
- Say "topics" not "keywords"
- Say "viewer interest" not "search volume"
- Use "SuperTopics" as the product hook

================================================================================

================================================================================
SECTION 9: DO'S AND DON'TS SUMMARY
================================================================================

DO:
✓ Use "topic" everywhere you'd normally say "keyword"
✓ Frame benefits around VIEWERS, not algorithms
✓ Speak like a helpful friend, not a marketing tool
✓ Keep copy concise and clear
✓ Use active, encouraging language
✓ Remember: "Built for the Viewer" is the philosophy

DON'T:
✗ Use SEO jargon (SERP, CTR, long-tail, etc.)
✗ Promise to "beat the algorithm" or "hack YouTube"
✗ Focus on rankings, competition, or search position
✗ Use corporate or salesy language
✗ Make it sound complicated or technical
✗ Forget that the END USER is a YouTube creator, not a marketer

================================================================================
SECTION 10: APPLYING THIS GUIDE
================================================================================

FOR AI AGENTS:
When generating any user-facing text in Super Topics:
1. Check if you're using any "Never Use" terms
2. Replace with the "Always Use" equivalent
3. Ensure the benefit is framed around viewers, not algorithms
4. Read it aloud — does it sound like a helpful friend?

FOR NEW FEATURES:
Before naming or describing a new feature:
1. Does the name avoid SEO terminology?
2. Is the description viewer-focused?
3. Would a YouTube creator feel excited, not overwhelmed?

FOR ERROR MESSAGES:
1. Be human
2. Offer a solution
3. Don't use technical jargon
